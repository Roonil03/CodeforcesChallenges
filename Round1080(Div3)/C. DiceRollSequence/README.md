A sequence b of integers from 1 to 6 is called a dice roll sequence if it satisfies the following condition:
- All pairs of adjacent elements lie on adjacent<sup>∗</sup> sides of the cube. 

For example, `[1,4,2]` is a dice roll sequence, while `[3,4,6,3]` is not because 3 and 4 are not on adjacent sides of the dice. Additionally, `[2,2,4]` is not a dice roll sequence because 2 and 2 are on the same (not adjacent) side of the dice.

Given a sequence a of n integers from 1 to 6, you can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero).
- Select an index 1 ≤ i ≤ n and an integer 1 ≤ x ≤ 6. Then, change the value of a<sub>i</sub> to x. 

Please determine the minimum number of operations required to make a a dice roll sequence.

<sup>∗</sup><sub>Two sides of the cube S and T are called adjacent if they share exactly one edge of the cube. Do note that this condition implies S ≠ T as well.</sub>

### Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10<sup>5</sup>).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,…,a<sub>n</sub> (1 ≤ a<sub>i</sub> ≤ 6).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10<sup>5</sup>.
### Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of operations required to make a a dice roll sequence.

### Examples:
**Input:**
```
3
3
1 4 2
4
3 4 6 3
10
6 1 4 3 1 3 2 5 4 4
```
**Output:**
```
0
1
4
```
**Note:**

For the first test case, the sequence a is [1,4,2]. As this is already a dice roll sequence, the answer is 0.

For the second test case, the sequence a is [3,4,6,3].

Changing exactly one element, you can get [3,**5**,6,3], which is a dice roll sequence.

For the third test case, the sequence a is [6,1,4,3,1,3,2,5,4,4].

Changing exactly 4 elements, you can get [**5**,1,4,**2**,1,3,2,**1**,**5**,4], which is a dice roll sequence.
